# This example implements an aspect "routing" pattern.
#
# Unlike `den.default` which is `parametric.atLeast`
# we use `parametric.fixedTo` here, which help us
# propagate an already computed context to all includes.
#
# This aspect, when installed in a `parametric.atLeast`
# will just forward the same context.
# The `mutual` helper returns an static configuration which
# is ignored by parametric aspects, thus allowing
# non-existing aspects to be just ignored.
#
# Be sure to read: https://vic.github.io/den/dependencies.html
# See usage at: defaults.nix, mbainter.nix, tyr.nix
